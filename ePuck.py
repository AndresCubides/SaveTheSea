#		-- ePuck.py --
#	
#		The aim of this library is to provide access to the ePuck robots
#		through a bluetooth connection. Thus, you can write a program that 
#		read from the ePuck's sensors and write in their actuators, This 
#		will allow us to create advanced programs that can develop a wide 
#		variety of complex tasks. It is necesary that the ePuck has installed 
#		the Webot's fimware 1.4.2 or 1.4.3. You can find this fantastic 
#		simulator on this site: http://www.cyberbotics.com/
#
#		This library is written in Python 2.6, and you can import it from
#		any program written in Python  (same version or later). In addition 
#		to this, you will also need two extra libraries:
#
#			-> Python Bluetooth or Pybluez
#			-> Python Image Library (PIL)
#
#		In this package you will find some examples of how to use this library.
#
#		You may expetience some problems when you work with your ePuck, We 
#		recommend you take into consideration the following special 
#		characteristic: we use a bluetooth communciation, therefore our bandwith 
#		is limited and we cannot expect to do too many tasks in short 
#		time; i.e:  If you put the wheels speed to max and want 
#		to make a quick process of the images, you will know what I'm saying. 
#		So remember, you are processing in your computer, not on the ePuck, 
#		and you need to take the sensors data and write on the actuators 
#		values on the ePuck
#
